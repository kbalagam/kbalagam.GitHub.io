### Dataset: House Rent Prediction Dataset
### Potential applications and values: I found this dataset from Kaggle which was mentioned in the awesome-datascience GitHub repository. This dataset piqued my attention because I personally always wanted to create a platform for the people where they can estimate the price of a house in a region before buying them. This dataset has various features that can help in determining the price of a house. These features include: BHK, Rent, Size, Floor, Area Type, Area Locality, City, Furnishing Status, Bathroom, Bedroom etc. We can make use of these features to develop a Machine Learning model that can predict the price of the house.

### Book Name - The Promise and Peril of Big Data by David Bollier. 

### By reading the book, I understood that the book will provide us with a wealth of fascinating insights on big data and its uses. The book explores how big data affects social and business settings as well as how it affects healthcare. It also addresses the topic of privacy worries brought on by the use of big data in a variety of fields. With the use of a wealth of data, this book enables us to investigate correlations, causality, and strategic decision-making. This main justification served as the basis for my selection of this particular book.
